# so sleep deprivation is getting the best of me--I am positive in "normal' circumstances I can do this with relative ease
# but I cant focus or concentrate on anything, and the internet keeps kicking me off
# every 5 seconds. I DO know that I have a bit of trouble breaking things down if I feel that I have an idea of how to solve it
# I wish I could demonstrate this right now. I fell like I will be unfairly assessed because of this, but I also could be delusional
# because if I really think I know it, then under extreme duress(like now) I still should be able to do it. 
# so here is a first spec, but I cant concentrate on anything, and when I try to go to the epicodus website to get "inspriration" 
# (like revisiting 'each' loops) and put things together, the internet keeps kicking me off.
# frustration is the understatement of the century, in this case.
# this is like one of those anxiety nightmares and I'm hoping that Im actualy dreaming right now
# and that my alarm is going to wake me up at any moment.
